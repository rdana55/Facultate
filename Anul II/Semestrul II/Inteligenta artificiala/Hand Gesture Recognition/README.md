## 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures, specifically **sign language digits from 1 to 9**, as well as gestures for **"like"** and **"palm"**. The core of the project is a smart **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained to identify these gestures with high accuracy.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Gesture Recognition**: The CNN model is capable of identifying a range of hand gestures used in sign language.
- **Background Elimination**: Advanced techniques ensure the app focuses solely on hand movements, enhancing recognition accuracy.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Gestures are processed in real-time, making the tool practical for accessibility and human-computer interaction applications.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This project demonstrates the potential of combining **computer vision** and **deep learning** technologies to create real-time gesture recognition tools. Such tools can significantly improve **accessibility** and usability in various computing environments.
